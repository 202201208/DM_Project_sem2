    <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold dark:text-white">Edge Detection</h2>


    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      An edge in an image is a significant local change in the image intensity. As the name suggests,
edge detection is the process of detecting the edges in an image.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      There are many types of filter for Edge Detection.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold dark:text-white mt-8" id="frequency_domain">1<sup>st</sup> Order Derivative Filters :</h3>
    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      First order derivatives in x and y direction as it gives large values when there is large changes in
intensities (at edges) so we use it as an edge detector.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      x, y derivatives of the image are also called x, y gradients of the image.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white mt-8" id="perwitfilter">Perwit Filter :</h4>

    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      Let us see how we can calculate the y gradient, the same kind of logic will apply for x gradient.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      We want to find the change or difference in intensity for every pixel, so we want for every pixel is
to tell us the difference between the top and bottom pixel.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"> operator T is defined over a neighborhood of point (x,y) of image
      Therefore, we just have to subtract the top and bottom pixel and store the gradient in the current
pixel.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"> operator T is defined over a neighborhood of point (x,y) of image
      For achieving that we have kernel shown below :
    </p>

    <figure class="max-w-lg mx-auto mt-4">
      <img class="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg" src="/static/learn/edge_1.png" alt="matrix">
    </figure>

    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      Similarly if we wanted to calculate the horizontal gradient we would use a kernal given below :
    </p>
    <figure class="max-w-lg mx-auto mt-4">
      <img class="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg" src="/static/learn/edge_2.png" alt="matrix">
    </figure>

    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      We will use matrix instead of the vector because if we take more pixels in account we will get
better estimate of the gradient. So we will use 3X3 matrix.
    </p>

    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      To calculate y gradient we can use this matrix :
    </p>
    <figure class="max-w-lg mx-auto mt-4">
      <img class="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg" src="/static/learn/edge_3.png" alt="matrix">
    </figure>

    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      To calculate x gradient we can use this matrix :
    </p>
    <figure class="max-w-lg mx-auto mt-4">
      <img class="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg" src="/static/learn/edge_4.png" alt="matrix">
    </figure>

    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      And this filters are called the Prewitt filters.
    </p>

    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
     Limitation of this Prewitt filter is that it is sensitive to noise in the image and it responds to
high-frequency components, which can include noise, resulting into false edge detection.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white mt-8" id="sobelfilter">Sobel Filter :</h4>


    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      To overcome the limitation of Prewitt filter we use Sobel Filters.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      We can make gradient calculation more accurate and noise free if we perform some noise reduction
technique such as Gaussian blurring on the image before applying gradient filter.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Blurring is convolution operation and gradient is also a convolution operation so we can combine
      both of these into a single convolution operation.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">So resulting Sobel filter in x and y direction is :
    </p>
    <figure class="max-w-lg mx-auto mt-4">
      <img class="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg" src="/static/learn/edge_5.png" alt="matrix">
    </figure>
    <figure class="max-w-lg mx-auto mt-4">
      <img class="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg" src="/static/learn/edge_6.png" alt="matrix">
    </figure>
    <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Now we can calculate Gradient value G using these two values of Gx and Gy by this equation:
    </p>
    <div class="center dark:bg-gray-900 text-center">
      <p class="dark:text-white"><span class="math inline">\(G = \sqrt{G{y}^{2} + G{y}^{2}}\)</span></p>
    </div>



    <div class="center dark:bg-gray-900 text-center mt-3">
      <p class="dark:text-white"><span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>=<span
      class="math inline">\(\tan^{-1}(G{y}/G{x})\)</span></p>
      </div>

          <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold dark:text-white mt-8" id="frequency_domain">2<sup>nd</sup> Order Derivative Filters :</h3>
          <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white mt-8" id="laplacianfilter">Laplacian Filter :</h4>

          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Sobel Filter take one derivative and find an edge in either of the horizontal direction or in the
            vertical direction (x or y).
          </p>   
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">In Laplacian filter, we can get edges in both dimensions for this we have to take double derivative
            of the intensities. At the edges double derivation of the graph points to zero. So we will check
            those pixels which lead to zero and then mark them as edge points.
          </p>   
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">For double derivation of every pixel we can use this equation :
          </p>   
          <figure class="max-w-lg mx-auto mt-4">
            <img class="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg" src="/static/learn/edge_7.jpg" alt="matrix">
          </figure>

          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Some of the most common filter to create Laplacian are :
          </p> 
          <figure class="max-w-lg mx-auto mt-4">
            <img class="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg" src="/static/learn/edge_8.png" alt="matrix">
          </figure>
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">This kernel are derived from the above equation.
          </p> 
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Laplacian filter is too sensitive to noise. So, it will work badly if there is noise in the image
            and therefore we apply Gaussian Blur to smooth the image and make the Laplacian filter more
            effective.
          </p> 
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Due to this addition of the gaussian filter, the overall filter is always in a pair. So this is usually
            call Laplacian over the Gaussian Filter (LoG).
          </p> 
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">And this LoG operator is shown below :
          </p> 
          <figure class="max-w-lg mx-auto mt-4">

          <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white mt-8" id="cannyedgedetector">The Canny Edge Detector :</h4>
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            The Canny edge detector is the most well known and the most used edge detector in image
processing.
          </p> 
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            The gradient representation is a bit noisy so if we use that filter we are left with a lots of noise
            inside the image.
          </p> 
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            So instead of gradient we’ll use Canny Edge detector.
          </p> 
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Canny Edge detection is a multi-step processing which contain 4 steps.
          </p> 
          <ol class="max-w-md space-y-1 text-gray-500 list-decimal list-inside dark:text-gray-400">

              Applying Gaussian smoothing to the image to help reduce noise.

            <li>

          </ol>
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            First 2 steps are same as above Sobel Filter.
          </p> 
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            So we’ll see next 2 steps.
          </p> 

          <h5 class="text-xl font-bold dark:text-white mt-8">NON-MAXIMA SUPPRESSION :</h5>
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            It’s an edge thinning process.
          </p> 
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            In most of the cases the edges are not sharp and clear, so at the end the algorithm will detect
multiple edges for a single edge because the surrounding area around the edges also have high
gradients.
          </p> 
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            To resolve this, we can apply edge thinning using non-maxima suppression. This filters out
unnecessary and weak detections.
          </p> 
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            To apply non-maxima suppression, we need to examine the gradient magnitude G and orientation
            θ at each pixel in the image and:
          </p> 
          <ol class="max-w-md space-y-1 text-gray-500 list-decimal list-inside dark:text-gray-400">
            <li>
              Compare the current pixel to the 3X3 neighborhood pixels surrounding it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Decide in which direction orientation is pointing:
              <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                If it’s pointing towards the north or south, then examine the north and south magnitude.
              </p> 
              <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                If it’s pointing towards the east or west, then examine the east and west pixels.
              </p> 
            </li>
            <li>
              If the center pixel magnitude is greater than both the pixels it is being compared to, then store
the magnitude. Otherwise, discard it.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h5 class="text-xl font-bold dark:text-white mt-8">Hysteresis thresholding</h5>
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">After applying non-maxima suppression, we may have to remove regions of an image that are not
            really edges, but still responded as edges after applying the gradient magnitude and non-maximum
            suppression.
          </p>
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            To ignore these unnecessary edges of an image, we need to define 2 thresholds: Tupper and Tlower.
          </p>
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            For any gradient value G >Tupper is sure that it’s an edge.
          </p>
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Any gradient value G < Tlower is surely not an edge, so immediately discard that edge.
          </p>
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            And for gradient value that falls into the range Tlower < G < Tupper needs to check these two
conditions:
          </p>
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            If the particular gradient value is connected to an edge >Tupper then consider that pixel as an
edge.
          </p>
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            If the gradient pixel is not connected to an edge, then discard it.
          </p>
          <p class="my-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            And that’s how Hysteresis thresholding works.
